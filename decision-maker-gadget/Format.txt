How is the state stored?
------------------------

There is some redundancy for making the data easier to access.

1) Count of votes.
One entry for each Decision.
Key: The word 'votecount' followed by the separator, followed by the complete
title of the Decision in low case and trimmed.
Value: Integer. Number of total votes that decision has, among all users.

2) Voters.
One entry for each Decision.
Key: The word 'voters' followed by the separator, followed by the complete title
of the Decision in low case and trimmed.
Value: String. List of users that have voted for that decision, separated by the
separator. Beginning and ending by the separator.
(Example: "|user1@kune.cc|user2@kune.cc|user3@kune.cc|")

3) Title.
One single entry.
Key: 'title'.
Value: The title of the desired decision
